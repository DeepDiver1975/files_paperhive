# About ownCloud, PaperHive and Collabora

Collabora and ownCloud announced a partnership and released Collabora Online Development Edition, a VM containing LibreOffice Online and ownCloud Server. LibreOffice Online is what the name suggests – an online version of the well known LibreOffice suite of productivity apps: word processor Writer, spreadsheet Calc and presentation tool Impress.

Researchers, students, medicine and engineering specialists collaborating in the research on the document in LibreOffice Online, are very frequently referencing to professional texts.

Researchers read 12-25 hours a week depending on their discipline. Yet, understanding research articles and books – some of the most complex documents in the world – is hard and inefficient in isolation. Students and inexperienced researchers waste time trying to decipher these texts alone, senior researchers dig through folders of articles irrelevant for their own work, and all at some point might repeat unknowingly others’ mistakes or include these as a citation in their own paper.

PaperHive, looks at how web platform could transform reading into a more social and active process of collaboration. It is a cross-publisher layer of interaction on top of research documents that enables contextual and structured discussions in real time.

Close to 1.2 million academic articles and books can currently be read and discussed with PaperHive.

# Transforming Reading Into Process of Collaboration

One of the greatest ownCloud features is sharing. Folders or files can be shared with groups, individual users or using a password protected or public links.

PaperHive document in that shared folder allows to legally share the research intellectual property with group of users, giving an option to quickly redirect to PaperHive page using `Discuss` button in the file list, which additionally shows the current number of discussions online

Transform your lectures, research and engineering work into process of collaboration with ownCloud, PaperHive and Collabora!

# Add PaperHive book to ownCloud

PaperHive plugin is shipped with new file menu button "PaperHive Document", which allows adding the documents found on the PaperHive website at `https://paperhive.org`. These are no other files as your `.doc` or `.jpg` and will behave the same as any other files in ownCloud user interface.
